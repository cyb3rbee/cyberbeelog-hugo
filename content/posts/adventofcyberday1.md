## Day 1: Framework

The premise of today's challenge is about security framework. As we learned from the situation, Santa's website got hacked and defaced by an unknown actor. Our job is to help McSkidy (Santa's IT Admin) and her team to figure out their adversaries.

### Theory

The scenario here is about security, when things like this happened we must adhere to the company's security policies and procedure.

**Security Frameworks =** This is a documented process that defines what organization must follow to manage their security. It also include the steps to make following an attack.

**Cybersecurity Framework =** Developed by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) that provides a detailed guide for organizations to mitigate cybersecurity risk.

> The framewok focuses on five essential function:
```
Identify -> Protect -> Detect -> Respond -> Recover
```
**ISO 27000 Series =** Developed by International Organization of Standardization (ISO) that outline a security framework for different industries and sectors. ISO 27001 and 27002 are common for cybersecurity for creating, implementing, and managing ISMS (Information security Management System).

**MITRE Att&CK Framework =** Developed to indentify adversary plans of attack. The framework was established by known TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures). The framework was structured like a periodic table to easily map phases of the attack chain.

**Cyber Kill Chain =** Adopted by the military with the terminology "Kill Chain", it describes the structure of an attack. It consist of target identification, decision, order of the attack and destruction of the target.

> Here are the seven stages of Cyber Kill Chain:
