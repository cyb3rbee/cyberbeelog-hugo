## Day 2: Log Analysis
In this challenge, we are going to look at log files of the web server hosting "santagift.shop". It has been recently hijacked by the Bandit Yeti group and our
job is to understand what happened and possibly track down the group responsible.

## Theory
Log files are extremely important as it contains chronological records of events generated by the operating system, hardware components, and software applications.Log files exist in every OS (Microsoft, UNIX, and Mac) however, they varies in how you access them within the system. A good log file should consist an event timestamp, name of the service generating the event, and the log description.

Log files are crucial for maintaining system health and security, as they allow administrators to detect and address problems promptly. Analyzing log files can provide insights into system performance, user behavior, and patterns, which can be valuable for improving software and optimizing system resources.

## Walkthrough
First order of business is to deploy the machine. 

Here is the SSH credential to access the machine:
``` 
IP address: 10.10.217.162
Username: elfmcblue
Password: tryhackme!
```

> **_Once the machine is up and running, answer these following questions:_**
>
>   1.Ensure you are connected to the deployable machine in this task.
>
>   2. Use the ls command to list the files present in the current directory. How many log files are present?
>
>   3. Elf McSkidy managed to capture the logs generated by the web server. What is the name of this log file?
>
>   4. Begin investigating the log file from question #3 to answer the following questions.
>
>   5. On what day was Santa's naughty and nice list stolen?
>
>   6. What is the IP address of the attacker?
>
>   7. What is the name of the important list that the attacker stole from Santa?    
>
>   8. Look through the log files for the flag. The format of the flag is: THM{}

> ### Step 1
Were going to skip step 1 since we already turned on the machine.

> ### Step 2
In step 2, were going to use the command `ls`.

- `ls` is a linux command for listing files on your current directory.

- once we use the command we are presented with two files.

    - SSHD.log & webserver.log
    - With this clue in mind we can answer question 2 & 3. 

 
> ### Step 3

- In this step we are looking towards investigating the log files. First, we have to look at the webserver.log file to answer 5, 6, & 7.

    - I used the `less` command here but you can use `cat` or even open it within a text editor (nano, vim).

    - From this log we can find out when the web server got hacked and the IP address of the attacker.
    - In addition we can see that gobuster was used to get into the server.
    - Looking at the log we can find the clue to answering question 5 and 6.
