Hello! and welcome to cyberbeelog. My name is Mak and I'm an avid cybersecurity student residing in California. I made this website to help document my journey in cybersecurity and IT in general. My goal is to blog write-ups of things I learned in cybersecurity and also post current projects that I'm working on. This website also serve as my knowledge library when I need a refresher. Since this is a blog, I don't want to be too formal but I will try to be as detailed on my writing as I can.

### A little bit about me

I am fairly new to the tech industry. Prior to my career change I was working in the pharmacy as a tech. I like my healthcare career but something inside of me is calling out to pursue a career in tech. I've always been fascinated in technology and how they work. At some point in my life I learned how to build computers and build a simple website. I like the learning experience of it and until today I always keep myself up to date on whats new in the industry. However, for a long time, I only see it as a hobby as I already built up a career in health. Now, I'm happy I finally pursue it and I cannot wait what kind of future awaits me in this journey.
